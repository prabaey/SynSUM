Note 1517
-------------------
**History**

The patient presents with complaints of persistent nasal congestion symptoms and recurrent episodes of wheezing, reporting that the episodes of dyspnea typically worsen at night and seem to be precipitated by exposure to allergens like dust and pollen. There is no associated respiratory pain, and the cough has notably been absent throughout these episodes. The patient has a history of asthma which has well-documented exacerbations coinciding with similar exposure patterns in the past. They report the use of a rescue inhaler two to three times per week recently, though they feel it has been less effective in the past few days.

**Physical Examination**

Vital signs within normal limits. Nasal mucosa appears swollen and erythematous. Respiratory examination reveals bilateral wheezing on auscultation, moderately more pronounced over the lower lung fields. No tracheal deviation or use of accessory muscles observed.

Note 4535
-------------------
**History**
The patient presented with severe cough onset approximately five days ago, noting a lack of associated fever. Symptoms also include nasal congestion and runny nose. The patient reports having no difficulties with breathing (dyspnea) and denies any respiratory pain. Despite the severe coughing, there is no fever or other indications of systemic infection. The patient has a known history of hay fever and reports an increase in nasal symptoms consistent with this condition. Symptomatic management with over-the-counter medications, including antihistamines, has provided limited relief. 

**Physical Examination**
On examination, the patient appears alert and in mild distress due to the persistent cough. Auscultation of the lungs reveals clear breath sounds with no wheezes, crackles, or abnormal respiratory sounds. Nasal passages appear erythematous and swollen but without purulence. Oropharynx is clear and non-erythematous. No lymphadenopathy noted upon neck examination. Vital signs are within normal limits, and there is no indication of fever.

**History**
The patient presented with a gurgling cough that has persisted for the past week. They reported occasional mild respiratory pain, most noticeable when taking deep breaths. While they have a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), they indicated that this current symptomatology feels somewhat different from their typical experiences with COPD exacerbations. The patient denies any dyspnea or significant changes in sputum production. They also mentioned that their energy levels have been stable, and there have not been any new triggers, such as exposure to pollutants or allergens.

**Physical Examination**
On inspection, the patient appeared in no acute distress and exhibited a slightly increased work of breathing. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles and gurgling sounds localized predominantly over the lower lobes bilaterally. No wheezing was appreciated. Respiratory rhythm was regular with no significant tachypnea noted. Palpation did not elicit any considerable increase in tenderness over the chest or ribcage. Peripheral oxygen saturation was within normal limits.

**History**
Patient presented with complaints of dyspnea, notably during asthma attacks, and a persistent dry cough. They reported that the shortness of breath exacerbates particularly during physical exertion and is often accompanied by the aforementioned cough, which remains unproductive. According to the patient, the coughing episodes tend to worsen at night, disrupting sleep. The patient has a history of asthma and has experienced multiple similar episodes in the past, for which they have been prescribed a rescue inhaler that provides temporary relief. They have consistently used their maintenance inhaler but report that symptoms have recently escalated despite this regimen.

Note 7933
-------------------
**History**
The patient presents with complaints of dyspnea, noted more significantly as nighttime stuffiness interfering with sleep. They report experiencing a high fever for the past three days, accompanied by generalized malaise and fatigue. Chronic asthma is managed with prescribed inhalers, which has offered limited relief recently. There are reported nasal symptoms including congestion and a runny nose. Additionally, the patient has had a persistent cough characterized by production of thick, yellow sputum, which has exacerbated since the onset of these symptoms.

**Physical Examination**
Vitals show elevated temperature at 101.4°F. Respiratory examination reveals bilateral wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase. There is noticeable nasal mucosal swelling with erythritic turbinates. Postnasal drip visible. Lung auscultation reveals coarse rhonchi present in bilateral lower lobes. Sputum assessment confirms purulent, yellowish secretions. No cyanosis or use of accessory muscles noted. Lymph nodes not appreciably swollen. Oxygen saturation is within acceptable ranges, but slightly decreased from the patient's baseline.
