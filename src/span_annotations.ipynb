No notable changes in daily routine or exposure to environments that might typically contribute to fever are reported. Recent stress levels and potential exposure to infectious agents during travels are also discussed.  **Physical Examination** Vital signs show elevated temperature (103 °F). Heart rate is slightly tachycardic at 98 bpm, corresponding with the fever. Oxygen saturation is within normal limits at 98%, and lungs are clear to auscultation without any added sounds. Abdominal examination is normal, without tenderness or organomegaly. Skin shows no rashes, warmth, or lesions. Capillary refill time is adequate. Neurological assessment is non-focal. Overall, there are no evident physical findings to explain the fever apart from the stated temperature elevation.\"\n"
