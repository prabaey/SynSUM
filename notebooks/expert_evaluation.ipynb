Headaches are described as bilateral, throbbing, and moderate in intensity, often alleviated by over-the-counter analgesics. No associated fever, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, or respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, blocked nose, or cough are noted. The patient has a stable diet and regular sleep schedule, but noted increased screen time lately.\\n\\n**Physical Examination**\\nA generally healthy-looking patient with a BMI within normal range. Vital signs: BP 115/70 mmHg, HR 64 bpm, Temp 98.5°F. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular heart rhythm without murmurs. Lungs are clear and without abnormalities.

       "4867  **History**\\nThe patient reports experiencing a high fever for the past three days. They describe the fever as consistently high, not fluctuating throughout the day. During this time, the patient has intentionally taken their temperature twice a day using a clean thermometer, which has consistently read above 102°F. The patient emphasizes no accompanying cough, which they typically experience with febrile illnesses. The patient maintains adequate hydration and a regular diet. Before this onset, the patient has had no recent travel history or known exposure to any sick individuals. They deny any unusual activities or stressors leading up to the onset of fever.\\n\\n**Physical Examination**\\nOn examination, the patient is alert and oriented, though they appear flushed and mildly fatigued. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 103.1°F, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg. Skin is moist and warm to the touch with signs of mild diaphoretic episodes. Head and neck examination is normal, as is the examination of the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits, and the patient demonstrates normal strength and sensory responses throughout all extremities. The patient's general physician condition appears stable. \\n\\n   \n",

The patient describes frequent sneezing and a sensation of pressure around the sinuses, especially in the mornings. Denies any episodes of cough. The symptoms seem to worsen when exposed to colder environments or allergens, such as dust and pollen. There is no redness or irritation in the eyes, but the patient mentions a feeling of fatigue due to disrupted sleep.\\n\\n**Physical Examination**\\nVital signs are stable. Nasal turbinates appear erythematous and swollen upon inspection, with clear discharge noted bilaterally. Mild tenderness upon palpation of the maxillary sinuses. Throat examination shows a mildly erythematous oropharynx without exudates. No lymphadenopathy detected in the neck area. No abnormal breath sounds or adventitious sounds noted during lung auscultation. Cardiac auscultation reveals a regular rhythm without murmurs. No dermatological findings evident.   \n",
